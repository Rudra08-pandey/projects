# Wine Quality Prediction 

#### This is the machine learning project developed using python language. In this project we are using Wine Dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.  
#### We are splitting the data in 8:2 ratio and predicting the quality of wine through the test portion of dataset.
#### We are classifying and training our data through Decision Tree Classifier.
#### After that we are comparing the result of test label with its test feature and we are also generating a prediction score so as to check the efficiency of program 

# Installation 
#### Navigate to the cloned repository through cmd and type   
  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
```python setup.py```
