This repository contains an implementation of the projects outlined in front end development. The implementation is in Javascript.

Quick Start
-----------


# Open in a supported browser
chrome index.html
```

Browser support
---------------

The implementation uses a number of ES2016 features, including `let`, arrow functions, and classes, all without any transpilation. A recent enough browser is needed to support these features.
